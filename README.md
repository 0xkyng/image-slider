The code begins by selecting various elements from the HTML document using the document.querySelector and document.querySelectorAll methods. It selects the slider container, next and previous buttons, individual slides, and slide icons. These elements are stored in corresponding variables for later use.

    The code initializes some variables: numberOfSlides holds the total number of slides, and slideNumber keeps track of the currently active slide (initially set to 0).

    The next button functionality is implemented using an event listener. When the next button is clicked (nextBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {...}), the code removes the "active" class from all slides and slide icons. Then it increments slideNumber and checks if it exceeds the number of slides. If it does, slideNumber is reset to 0. Finally, the "active" class is added to the slide and slide icon corresponding to the updated slideNumber.

    Similarly, the previous button functionality is implemented in a similar manner using an event listener for the previous button (prevBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {...}).

    The autoplay functionality is implemented using a combination of setInterval and clearInterval. The repeater function is defined to handle the autoplay behavior. It first clears any existing interval (clearInterval(playSlider)), then sets a new interval using setInterval. Inside the interval function, it performs the same logic as the next button click event to switch to the next slide. This is repeated every 4 seconds (4000 milliseconds).

    The repeater function is called initially to start the autoplay when the page loads (repeater()).

    The code adds event listeners for the slider container's mouseover and mouseout events. When the mouse is over the slider, the autoplay is paused by clearing the interval (clearInterval(playSlider)). When the mouse moves out of the slider, the autoplay resumes by calling the repeater function again.
